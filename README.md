# Predicting-Energy-Consumption-for-Smart-Grids
predicting energy consumption using a linear regression model. 

**Definition:**
Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.
For a smart grid, energy consumption prediction involves using historical data such as temperature, time of day, and appliance usage patterns 
to model the relationship between these features and energy consumption.

**Reason behind Linear Regression**

Linear regression predicts energy consumption using a formula: 

𝑦=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑥1+𝛽2𝑥2+…+𝛽𝑛𝑥𝑛

​y: Predicted energy consumption.

𝑥𝑖 : Features like temperature, time, or appliance usage.

𝛽𝑖 : Model coefficients representing the weight of each feature.

β0 : Intercept term (baseline consumption).

**Steps used in Linear Regression**

**Step 1: Importing Libraries:**
Necessary Python libraries are imported, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization, along with sklearn modules for model building and evaluation.

**Step 2: Loading Dataset:**
The dataset is loaded using pandas. The file appears to be an Excel sheet named ENB2012_data.xlsx.

**Step 3: Data Preprocessing:**
This likely includes steps like handling missing values, scaling features (using StandardScaler), and preparing the data for model training.

**Step 4: Model Training:**
The LinearRegression model from sklearn is used to fit the training data.

**Step 5: Model Evaluation:**
Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

**Step 6: Predictions:**
The trained model is applied to new data to predict energy consumption.

**Why Linear Regression is Valuable in this Use Case**
Linear regression is valuable for predicting energy consumption in smart grids because 
it provides a simple, interpretable model to quantify the relationship between energy usage and factors like temperature, time, and appliance activity. 
It is computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time predictions and optimizations. 
Additionally, it allows grid operators to identify key drivers of consumption, enabling better resource planning and demand management 
while serving as a baseline for more complex models.
